## What is the Sustainability Companion app?

The Sustainability Companion app is a web application that helps users to track their CO2 emissions while traveling. The
app allows users to create trips and calculate the CO2 emissions for each trip. The app also provides
information about the CO2 emissions for each vehicle type.

## How to use the app

The project is split into two main parts: the companion app and the carbon footprint API. The project was developed in
Django and uses Django Rest Framework for the API. The companion app is a web application that allows users to create
trips and calculates the CO2 emissions for each trip. The carbon footprint API is a (for now) simple API that provides
information about the CO2 emissions for a give trip.

$ tree --gitignore -L 2

## API Endpoints

The OpenAPI / Swagger spec for the API can be found in the `/docs/` folder.
If you're using Intellij you can test the endpoint with the given `*.http` file in the `/test/` folder.

## Local Development

1. Have PyCharm and Python 3.10 installed
2. Clone the repository and open it in PyCharm
3. Create a virtual environment, if you don't have one already (PyCharm should create one)
4. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the migrations with `python manage.py migrate`
6. Run the server with `python manage.py runserver`
7. Access the app at `http://localhost:8000`

## Deployment to Azure
